'''
Given a string s, composed of different combinations of '(' , ')', '{', '}', '[', ']'. Determine whether the Expression is balanced or not.
An expression is balanced if:

Each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket of the same type.
Opening brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Examples :

Input: s = "[{()}]"
Output: true
Explanation: All the brackets are well-formed.
Input: s = "[()()]{}"
Output: true
Explanation: All the brackets are well-formed.
Input: s = "([]"
Output: false
Explanation: The expression is not balanced as there is a missing ')' at the end.
Input: s = "([{]})"
Output: false
Explanation: The expression is not balanced as there is a closing ']' before the closing '}'.

    stack = []
    pairs = {
        ')': '(',
        '}': '{',
        ']': '['
    }

    for ch in s:
        if ch in '([{':
            stack.append(ch)
        else:
            if not stack or stack[-1] != pairs[ch]:
                return False
            stack.pop()

    return len(stack) == 0
