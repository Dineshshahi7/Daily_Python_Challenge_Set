Given an integer array arr[] and an integer k, your task is to find and return the kth smallest element in the given array.

Note: The kth smallest element is determined based on the sorted order of the array.

Examples :

Input: arr[] = [10, 5, 4, 3, 48, 6, 2, 33, 53, 10], k = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: 4th smallest element in the given array is 5.
Input: arr[] = [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15], k = 3
Output: 7
Explanation: 3rd smallest element in the given array is 7.

def kthsmallest(arr, k):
    arr.sort()
    
    return arr[k-1]


print(kthsmallest([10, 5, 4, 3, 48, 6, 2, 33, 53, 10], 4))
